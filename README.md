## Overview of Election Audit
The election commission has requested additional information in order to complete the election audit. This includes

1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
3. The county that had the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Results
**Additional analysis of the election audit:**
- There were 369,711 total votes cast
- The total county votes and percentages include:
  - Jefferson county recieved 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 votes total.
  - Denver county recieved 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 votes total.
  - Arapahoe county recieved 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 votes total.
- Denver county had the largest number of votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
As we can see from the analysis, Denver county had a much higher voter turnout than Jefferson county and Arapahoe county. The candidate that people vote for in Denver will have a much higher chance of winning than the candidates that get votes in the other two counties. It might be useful in the future to analyze how many votes each candidate got in each specific county, rather than just the total amount. This would give us a better idea of who the counties were hoping to win. Because both Jefferson county and Arapahoe county didn't have the highest voter turnouts, it would be a good a idea for the next election to encourage more people to get out and vote. Getting more citizens to vote will create a more accurate respresentation of who the citizens want representing them.
